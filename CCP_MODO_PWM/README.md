IN THIS TUTORIAL YOU WILL FIND THE WAY TO WORK WITH THE CPP MODULE in PWM MODE THAT IS A PERIPHERAL OF THE dsPIC30F4013 DIGITAL SIGNAL CONTROLLER USING MPLABX IDE AND THE XC16 COMPILER.
BESIDES THAT , THE PWM SIGNAL IS USED TO CHANGE THE SPEED OF A DC MOTOR , CHANGING ITS DUTY CYCLE BY THE USE OF 2 BOTTONS THAT ONE IS FOR INCREASING 10 PERCENT OF THE DUTY CYCLE AND THE OTHER IS FOR DECREASING 10 PERCENT OF THE DUTY CYCLE.
DON'T FORGET TO SUSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL jorge miranda redes neuronales FOR MORE TUTORIALS OF DIGITAL SIGNAL CONTROLLER AND MANY MORE.
